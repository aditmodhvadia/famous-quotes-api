## Famous Quotes API with Deno

### Get some of the famous quotes that I know of and with contributions from the community.

Checkout [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to contribute.

## Get started

### 1. Install deno

You can find the instructions for it at [deno.land](https://deno.land/)

### 2. Checkout drun and denotrain

Install [drun](https://deno.land/x/drun). Do not forget to set the path if not set automatically, otherwise drun won't work properly. Checkout [denotrain](https://deno.land/x/denotrain). drun auto reloads the server for you and denotrain works like express for node.js, use it to create RESTfull APIs.

### 3. Run the server

``` shell
deno run --allow-net ./index.ts
```

### 4. Replace with your network address

Replace localhost with your local network address to communicate within your network
